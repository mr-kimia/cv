# About #

This is ongoing version of my CV. I try to keep it up-to-date, but can not
promise that it always represents the current state of my professional life.
The original template is created by [Adrien Friggeri][afriggeri] and it is available on
[GitHub][afriggerighcv].
The current version is based on [A4 version](https://github.com/depressiveRobot/friggeri-cv-a4) by [Marvin Frommhold](https://github.com/depressiveRobot).

The template is licenced with MIT license.

You can find the [compiled pdf version][cvpdf] from my web site [kimia.fi][kimia.fi].
